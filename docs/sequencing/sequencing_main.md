### Mk1C   
Nanopore libraries were sequenced using either a MinION Mk1B connected to a laptop with the [recommended specifications](https://community.nanoporetech.com/requirements_documents/minion-it-reqs.pdf) for Nanopore sequencing or a Mk1C using R9.4 flow cells and the recommended scripts in MinKNOW to generate fast5 files with live-basecalling enabled. In case of an observed drop in translocation speed and subsequent reduced read quality, we refueled the flow cells with flush buffer, as recommended by ONT. Also, the starting voltage of re-used flow cells was adjusted for the next run to account for the voltage drift during a sequencing run.
