# 3<sup>rd</sup> gen transcriptomics in prokaryotes by Nanopore sequencing of RNA and cDNA molecules
{: .fs-9 }

--- 
This collection of scripts and documentation, called **microbepore**, is intended to make it easier for everyone to perform RNA-seq in prokaryotes using Nanopore technology.  
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }
It also serves to describe in detail the steps of our analysis of Nanopore RNA- and cDNA-seq in *Escherichia coli*, from experimental design to a comprehensive analysis of various transcriptomic features.
